# Music_Player
A music player application using wavesurfer-js JavaScript library.

## wavesurfer-js
* wavesurfer-js is a fantastic Javascript library which generates waveform for any audio. Refer [wavesurfer-js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/).
* It was amazing to work with.
* One tip though, based on the length of the audio, the time taken to generate waveform may vary. Shorter the audio, quicker the wave form generation.
* I recommend everyone to give this a shot! Happy Programming !!
